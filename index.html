        <h3>Bio</h3>

        <p>Born in Darlington, England, Dominica Plummer first studied theatre at Sheffield University, and in London, while working for Greater London Arts. After relocating to the United States, she studied dramaturgy and dramatic criticism at the Yale School of Drama, under the mentorship of Richard Gilman. While teaching theatre at various colleges and universities in the United States, she began to write plays. A year back in the United Kingdom in 2014 enabled her to work with John Burgess, director and former literary manager at the National Theatre. Returning to the United States in 2016, her short play The Jinx was read at the Midwest Dramatists Conference, and later published by Next Stage Press in Extra Innings, a collection of short plays about baseball. In 2019, Dominica decided to permanently relocate to London, England, to focus on her work as a theatre critic and playwright. In 2022, she completed a full length drama, ANTWERP 1658, while part of John Retallackâ€™s playwriting group in Oxford, England.</p>
